1. introduce highlighting (both for sessionwidget and previewwidget)
2. make an updateThumbnail() call for every tab on resize of a sessionwidget.
3. add buttons to add, remove, deactivate sessions from panorama. make the titleEdit work.
4. allow drag-drop (most important)
5. create a dedicated class for loading and storing sessions. Preferably have an abstract base class with subclasses for storing to XML, Nepomuk(?), etc.
